## Housekeeping
â€¢ We should probably talk about [your projects](../../projects/).

## Discussion:
Read and form an opinion about the [reductions in health care projections](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/01/opinion/paul-krugman-the-medicare-miracle.html?_r=0). 

What's good about the chart form? (Note [the original](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2010/02/02/us/politics/20100201-budget-porcupine-graphic.html), used for budget deficits.)

There was discussion among chart academics about whether you should show more data, or whether leaving it out is part of editing. Read both [Alberto](http://www.thefunctionalart.com/2014/08/to-make-visualizations-that-are.html) and [Kaiser's](http://junkcharts.typepad.com/junk_charts/2014/09/relevance-to-you-or-me-a-response-to-cairo.html) opinions, and form your own.

Who do you agree with and why? Think about your role as a journalist who's good at numbers: how much data should you show to prove your point?

A variety of people wrote about this piece and offered their own interpretations about the Times' report. 

[Krugman](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/01/opinion/paul-krugman-the-medicare-miracle.html?_r=0), [Vox](http://www.vox.com/2014/9/4/6101835/five-reasons-health-care-is-no-longer-a-monstrous-budget-buster), [Blahaus](http://economics21.org/commentary/sorry-new-york-times-medicare-cost-problem-remains-unsolved), [Wapo](http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/robert-samuelson-curb-your-enthusiasm-about-those-medicare-savings/2014/09/10/61fee81c-3903-11e4-9c9f-ebb47272e40e_story.html), [Forbes](http://www.forbes.com/sites/theapothecary/2014/08/31/medicare-no-longer-such-a-budget-buster/).

Which of these critiques makes the best or worst argument to a non-expert? Why? Did any of these articles leave you (and, by extension, other smart people) behind? How could they not have?

As always, Excel will determine who leads the discussion.
