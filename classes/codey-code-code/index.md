Thus far, we've gotten good at our core skills – sort, filter, merge and aggregate. But communicating that information on the internet is just as important. We'll finish up last week's data cleaning exercise, then get into some coding.

##Housekeeping

- About that [wiki page](https://github.com/kpq/nyu-data-journalism-fall-2014/wiki/Class-table). Should we do it together?
- We'll get pitches back to you Sunday night.
- [Critique time](https://github.com/kpq/nyu-data-journalism-fall-2014/wiki/Critique-schedule)

##From last week: finishing up your data join exercise.

We'll finish our exercise [from last time](../lester-freamon/), which was supposed to be about learning that data isn't perfect. (Instead, it devolved into a pivot table exercise, which is also just fine.)

No need to start from scratch; this [excel file](chicago-starter.xlsx) should get you on your way.

Goal: get a county fips code for at least 95% of all guns and counties. Making a pivot table if `no_match` and `guns' could help. Or just filter.

##Basic HTML and CSS

You don't necessarily need to know html and CSS to be successful journalist in 2014, but having a good understanding of how it works – and especially how to make or edit small things – will still be useful. Also, considering many of the people hiring you don't know the difference between basic internet competency and a computer science degree, help keep them fooled as long as possible. (Part of this exercise is stolen/adapted from [Code With Me](http://codewithme.us/austin/exercises.html), which has great lessons.)

1. Make a folder for today's class on your computer. Inside it, make a file called `index.html`. Open the file, write your name on it, and save it. Then open it in a web browser, and blamo! 

2. How might formatting help us here?

3. Insert `<html>`, `<head>`, `<title>` and `<body>` tags to make your page valid. Tabs matter!

4. Check out some [sample content](base-markup.txt) we may have written as a class based on our excel exercises. Paste it into the `body` of your HTML page, and let's mark it up. You might want to use [these docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/HTML5/HTML5_element_list) as a reference.

5. Style the content to look as much like NYT content as possible. Use the inspector!
