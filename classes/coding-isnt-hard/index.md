## Housekeeping

• Let's discuss your projects and our feedback on your [projects](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18PTOMXbPqJaTaK9jp9ijuxKvFg_ctK1g0QM2-qhWbcY/edit).

## Discussion:
[Talking football](http://www.fivethirtyeight.com/features/madden/), and thinking about what data is out there.

##Basic HTML and CSS

You don't necessarily need to know html and CSS to be successful journalist in 2014, but having a good understanding of how it works – and especially how to make or edit small things – will still be useful. Also, considering many of the people hiring you don't know the difference between basic internet competency and a computer science degree, help keep them fooled as long as possible. (Part of this exercise is stolen/adapted from [Code With Me](http://codewithme.us/austin/exercises.html), which has great lessons.)

1. Make a folder for today's class on your computer. Inside it, make a file called `index.html`. Open the file, write your name on it, and save it. Then open it in a web browser, and blamo! 


4. Check out some [sample content](base-onion-markup.txt). Let's mark it up as a class. You might want to use [these docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/HTML5/HTML5_element_list) as a reference.

5. We'll style this to look as much like the Onion as possible. Use your inspector!

##Advanced
If there's time, take this [recent Upshot article](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/05/upshot/ben-bernanke-has-an-impressive-passive-aggressive-streak-and-other-things-we-learned-in-the-new-fed-transcripts.html?abt=0002&abg=1) and mark it up on your own. Here is the [starter file](bernanke.txt). You can add links if you're feeling fancy. Here's the catch: make it look like <a href="http://www.vox.com/2015/3/4/8149547/ferguson-racism-police-courts">a Vox article</a>.

##Homework
Re-pitch your project with the feedback you received from your classmates and us. Think focus + small/manageable.
