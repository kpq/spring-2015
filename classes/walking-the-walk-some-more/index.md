Today, we continue making [our application](http://projects.propublica.org/drug-labels/) we started last week.

##Housekeeping

- General thoughts on project re-pitches.
- How are our class github pages?
- [Critique time](https://github.com/kpq/nyu-data-journalism-fall-2014/wiki/Critique-schedule)
- What were our best lessons in programming frmo last time? When were searches successful and when weren't they?

##Let's Keep Making an App
If you need to start with something, you could start with this.

Overall, we saw lots we liked. Here's a starter file if you need. (Nice [Julia](http://juliashu.github.io/data-journalism/ProPublica%20Mimic/index.html)!)
