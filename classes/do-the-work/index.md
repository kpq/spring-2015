## Housekeeping
• We finish [introducing ourselves](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1W753AamUgr9wTKawTzDbJooIbyP_v5H_iWZg9a8ZTZY/edit#gid=0).

• You turned in your [homework](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18PTOMXbPqJaTaK9jp9ijuxKvFg_ctK1g0QM2-qhWbcY/edit), yes?

## Discussion:
[Structured information](http://nextcity.org/features/view/what-is-the-best-way-to-sell-a-train-ticket), and reducing things to their essence, maybe.

##Enough to make you dangerous

        border-collapse: collapse;

##Beginner html/css.

1. Just enough tags: div, p, h1-7, img, a, span
2. Save this [starter page](http://kpq.github.io/nyu-data-journalism-fall-2014/misc/project-template.html) to your computer and open it in both your text editor and chrome.
3. Why does your page look different from the one on the internet? (There are some clues in your console.) 
4. Make the body copy look more like [medium's](https://medium.com/message/just-checking-in-d2b5540f0064). (Your web inspector will help you.)

##Tell your story!

Make a piece of journalism using the Chicago guns data you cleaned last week.  

- Cloropleth map group. Here's an [example](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4060606) we were inspired by a few weeks ago.
- Table group. [Mr. Data Converter may help you](http://shancarter.github.io/mr-data-converter/)
- Words only group.
