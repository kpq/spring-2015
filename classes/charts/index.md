The basic types of charts include line charts, area charts, bar charts, scatterplots and pie charts. How should you decide which one to use? And how can we make them?

##Housekeeping

- [Project timeline.](../../projects/) Are you on track for success?
- It's about time you critiqued something of ours. What's your take on these [pictures from a comet](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/11/12/science/space/rosetta-philae-comet-landing.html)? Or, since that one is so obviously awesome, what about this [map and charts](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/upshot/mapping-the-spread-of-drought-across-the-us.html?abt=0002&abg=1) about the drought, which Amanda and Kevin disagree about? (We'll talk more about droughts later.)

##More lecture than we've ever had before

- [Choosing a good chart](http://extremepresentation.typepad.com/files/choosing-a-good-chart-09.pdf) and [a reduced version](http://kpq.github.io/sherp-31/assets/lectures/charts-reduced.pdf) 
- [What are you trying to say?](http://lulupinney.co.uk/2012/08/what-are-you-trying-to-say/)
- [How can you use design to help you say it?](http://i.imgur.com/RzYaLZg.gif) and for [tables](http://i.imgur.com/ZY8dKpA.gif)
- [Some chart examples](http://kpq.github.io/sherp-31/assets/lectures/chartexamples.pdf)
- [Some general design help](http://www.visualmess.com) or [more](http://lenagroeger.s3.amazonaws.com/cuny-spring14/designclass.html)

##Your goal
- More droughts! Before class is over, post line chart showing the percent of California in moderate to exceptional drought since 2005, based on [this source](http://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/MapsAndData/DataTables.aspx). If you feel like a boss, make a bar chart for each state's most recent value. Post it to your github page.
- Style a paragraph of text below your chart, borrowing inspriration from the way [Medium](https://medium.com/cool-code-pal/70abf2d96a10) styles their paragraphs

##Your team choices

- Team Excel
 - You might follow [Cole Nussbaumer's guide.](http://www.storytellingwithdata.com/2011/11/how-to-do-it-in-excel.html)
- Team Service
  - You might try out [Datawrapper](http://datawrapper.de/) or [Chartbuilder](http://quartz.github.io/Chartbuilder/)
- Team Be in Charge
  - You might try out [D3](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Gallery)


[Variance](https://variancecharts.com/examples/) has a nice description of some of the trade-offs. And people are working on tools, like [Lyra](http://idl.cs.washington.edu/projects/lyra/), that blend some of your options.
