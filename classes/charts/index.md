The basic types of charts include line charts, area charts, bar charts, scatterplots and pie charts. How should you decide which one to use? And how can we make them?

##Chart activities
Charts are all about deciding what information you want to communicate to your readers. Let's discuss the goals of these ten charts and decide on a headline for each based on what we think the author is trying to communicate.

##Let's play a game
We'll hand you two printouts. Let's label them, then discuss.

##Your goal
Is to make a chart about the drought in the U.S. Before class is over, make a chart that answers one of the following questions:

• Is this California's worst drought ever?
• Are there states that are in bigger trouble than California?
• When was the worst year for Droughts in the United States since 1990?

No matter what you choose, [this source](http://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/MapsAndData/DataTables.aspx) should have the data you're looking for.

Style a paragraph of text below your chart, borrowing inspriration from the way [Medium](https://medium.com/cool-code-pal/70abf2d96a10) styles their paragraphs

##Your team choices

- Team Excel
 - You might follow [Cole Nussbaumer's guide.](http://www.storytellingwithdata.com/2011/11/how-to-do-it-in-excel.html)
- Team Service
  - You might try out [Datawrapper](http://datawrapper.de/) or [Chartbuilder](http://quartz.github.io/Chartbuilder/)
- Team Be in Charge
  - You might try out [D3](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Gallery)


[Variance](https://variancecharts.com/examples/) has a nice description of some of the trade-offs. And people are working on tools, like [Lyra](http://idl.cs.washington.edu/projects/lyra/), that blend some of your options.
