<p>• We should probably talk about <a href="../../projects/">your projects</a>.</p>

<h2>Discussion:</h2>

<p>Read and form an opinion about the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/28/upshot/medicare-not-such-a-budget-buster-anymore.html">reductions in health care projections</a>. </p>

<p>What&rsquo;s good about the chart form? (Note <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2010/02/02/us/politics/20100201-budget-porcupine-graphic.html">the original</a>, used for budget deficits.)</p>

<p>There was discussion among chart academics about whether you should show more data, or whether leaving it out is part of editing. Read both <a href="http://www.thefunctionalart.com/2014/08/to-make-visualizations-that-are.html">Alberto</a> and <a href="http://junkcharts.typepad.com/junk_charts/2014/09/relevance-to-you-or-me-a-response-to-cairo.html">Kaiser&rsquo;s</a> opinions, and form your own.</p>

<p>Who do you agree with and why? Think about your role as a journalist who&rsquo;s good at numbers: how much data should you show to prove your point?</p>

<p>A variety of people wrote about this piece and offered their own interpretations about the Times&#39; report. </p>

<p>Which of these critiques makes the best or worst argument to a non-expert? Why? Did any of these articles leave you (and, by extension, other smart people) behind? How could they not have?</p>

<p>As always, Excel will determine who leads the discussion.</p>
