<p>• Let&rsquo;s discuss your projects and our feedback on your <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/18PTOMXbPqJaTaK9jp9ijuxKvFg_ctK1g0QM2-qhWbcY/edit">projects</a>.</p>

<h2>Discussion:</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.fivethirtyeight.com/features/madden/">Talking football</a>, and thinking about what data is out there.</p>

<h2>Basic HTML and CSS</h2>

<p>You don&rsquo;t necessarily need to know html and CSS to be successful journalist in 2014, but having a good understanding of how it works – and especially how to make or edit small things – will still be useful. Also, considering many of the people hiring you don&rsquo;t know the difference between basic internet competency and a computer science degree, help keep them fooled as long as possible. (Part of this exercise is stolen/adapted from <a href="http://codewithme.us/austin/exercises.html">Code With Me</a>, which has great lessons.)</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Make a folder for today&rsquo;s class on your computer. Inside it, make a file called <code>index.html</code>. Open the file, write your name on it, and save it. Then open it in a web browser, and blamo! </p></li>
<li><p>Check out some <a href="base-onion-markup.txt">sample content</a>. Let&rsquo;s mark it up as a class. You might want to use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/HTML5/HTML5_element_list">these docs</a> as a reference.</p></li>
<li><p>We&rsquo;ll style this to look as much like the Onion as possible. Use your inspector!</p></li>
</ol>

<h2>Advanced</h2>

<p>If there&rsquo;s time, take this <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/05/upshot/ben-bernanke-has-an-impressive-passive-aggressive-streak-and-other-things-we-learned-in-the-new-fed-transcripts.html?abt=0002&amp;abg=1">recent Upshot article</a> and mark it up on your own. Here is the <a href="bernanke.txt">starter file</a>. You can add links if you&rsquo;re feeling fancy. Here&rsquo;s the catch: make it look like <a href="http://www.vox.com/2015/3/4/8149547/ferguson-racism-police-courts">a Vox article</a>.</p>

<h2>Homework</h2>

<p>Re-pitch your project with the feedback you received from your classmates and us. Think focus + small/manageable.</p>
