<h1>Getting to know the 'black screen'</h1>

<div class="lesson">
  <p>Thus far, we&rsquo;ve gotten good at our core skills – sort, filter, merge and aggregate. But communicating that information on the internet is just as important. We&rsquo;ll finish up last week&rsquo;s data cleaning exercise, then get into some coding.</p>

<h2>Housekeeping</h2>

<ul>
<li>About that <a href="https://github.com/kpq/nyu-data-journalism-fall-2014/wiki/Class-table">wiki page</a>. Should we do it together?</li>
<li>We&rsquo;ll get pitches back to you Sunday night.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kpq/nyu-data-journalism-fall-2014/wiki/Critique-schedule">Critique time</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>From last week: finishing up your data join exercise.</h2>

<p>We&rsquo;ll finish our exercise <a href="../lester-freamon/">from last time</a>, which was supposed to be about learning that data isn&rsquo;t perfect. (Instead, it devolved into a pivot table exercise, which is also just fine.)</p>

<p>No need to start from scratch; this <a href="chicago-starter.xlsx">excel file</a> should get you on your way.</p>

<p>Goal: get a county fips code for at least 95% of all guns and counties. Making a pivot table if <code>no_match</code> and `guns&#39; could help. Or just filter.</p>

<h2>Basic HTML and CSS</h2>

<p>You don&rsquo;t necessarily need to know html and CSS to be successful journalist in 2014, but having a good understanding of how it works – and especially how to make or edit small things – will still be useful. Also, considering many of the people hiring you don&rsquo;t know the difference between basic internet competency and a computer science degree, help keep them fooled as long as possible. (Part of this exercise is stolen/adapted from <a href="http://codewithme.us/austin/exercises.html">Code With Me</a>, which has great lessons.)</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Make a folder for today&rsquo;s class on your computer. Inside it, make a file called <code>index.html</code>. Open the file, write your name on it, and save it. Then open it in a web browser, and blamo! </p></li>
<li><p>How might formatting help us here?</p></li>
<li><p>Insert <code>&lt;html&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> tags to make your page valid. Tabs matter!</p></li>
<li><p>Check out some <a href="base-markup.txt">sample content</a> we may have written as a class based on our excel exercises. Paste it into the <code>body</code> of your HTML page, and let&rsquo;s mark it up. You might want to use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/HTML5/HTML5_element_list">these docs</a> as a reference.</p></li>
<li><p>Style the content to look as much like NYT content as possible. Use the inspector!</p></li>
