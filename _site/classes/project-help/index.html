<h3>Has happened already</h3>

<ul>
<li>[ ] You have gathered your data.</li>
<li>[ ] You have a plan for your analysis, or perhaps have completed it.</li>
<li>[ ] You have identified the skills you need to learn to finish.</li>
<li>[ ] If you feel stuck, you have broken your problems into small, solvable pieces.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Will happen before two weeks from today</h3>

<ul>
<li>[ ] You have made a sketch of what your final product will be. Will you have charts, tables, maps or images? Will will be the dominant element: words or something else?</li>
<li>[ ] You have a draft of your words.</li>
<li>[ ] You have drafts of your non-words. (Remember: more is not better. One good chart is better than 6 okay ones.)</li>
<li>[ ] You have a plan for how your words will integrate with any other elements.</li>
<li>[ ] Your headline makes a point and sounds like something you want to read.</li>
<li>[ ] All of your data is sourced.</li>
</ul>

<h3>What we owe you</h3>

<ul>
<li>[ ] A template that you may use so you spend your remaining time on content, instead of, say, struggling with css. You may throw this template away, but it will probably have some decent ideas in it. (include a byline, include share tools?, be responsive for mobile.)</li>
</ul>
