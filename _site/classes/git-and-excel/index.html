  <p>How do you interview a spreadsheet like a human being? Today, we&rsquo;ll work on turning a spreadsheet into a story, a source, a chart or something else journalistically valuable.</p>

<h2>Housekeeping</h2>

<ul>
<li>  Make sure your info is right on the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1W753AamUgr9wTKawTzDbJooIbyP_v5H_iWZg9a8ZTZY/edit#gid=0">class roster</a></li>
<li>  Are you sure you&rsquo;ve signed up for the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/spring-2015-data-journalism">Google group</a>?</li>

<h2>Basic skills</h2>

<p>Here is some data on <a href = "drunkdrivingdeaths.xls">drunk driving deaths</a> in 2013 from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.</p>

<ol>
<li>Download the data to your computer, and open it in your spreadsheet program of choice. </li>
<li>What were the 3 states with the most deaths? The 3 with the fewest?</li>
<li>Find some state <a href = "http://www.census.gov/popest/data/state/totals/2013/"> population estimates</a>. Add them to your spreadsheet using a function called <code>vlookup</code>. </li>
<li>What were the states with the highest rates deaths due to drunk driving? The lowest?</li>
<li>How many deaths occured in the South? What region of the country had the highest rate of deaths? Here are some <a href = "http://kpq.github.io/sherp-31/assets/data/nytnames.xls">region codes</a> that might help you. For practice, answer this question by using a <code>pivot table</code>. Pivot tables are one way to summarize data.</li>
<li>On the second second sheet of the drunk driving data, there is a bit more data. Use this sheet to ask and answer a more interesting question than those we have answered so far.</li>
</ol>

<h2>It&rsquo;s exactly the same when your data is a little bigger.</h2>

<p>Here is some data on where <a href="http://kpq.github.io/nyu-data-journalism-fall-2014/classes/codey-code-code/chicago-starter.xlsx">guns recovered in Chicago</a> between 2001 and March 2012 came from.</p>

<ol>
<li>What counties did the most guns come from?</li>
<li>What counties in Mississippi did the most guns come from? The fewest?</li>
<li>What states did the most guns come from?</li>
<li><a href = "http://www.ers.usda.gov/dataFiles/CountyLevelDatasets/PopulationEstimates.xls"> Per capita?</a>. </li>
</ol>

<h2>Choose your own adventure.</h2>

<ol>
<li>Using some of the skills we learned last time, make a map about the guns recovered in Chicago.</li>
<li>What happens when the data is even bigger? Find the fire hydrant in NYC that now has the most tickets.</li>
</ol>
