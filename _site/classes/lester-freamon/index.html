<p>• We should probably talk about <a href="../../projects/">your projects</a>. - General thoughts on project pitches: think small + manageable</p>

<h2>Discussion:</h2>

<p>Read and form an opinion about the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/28/upshot/medicare-not-such-a-budget-buster-anymore.html">reductions in health care projections</a>. </p>

<p>What&rsquo;s good about the chart form? (Note <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2010/02/02/us/politics/20100201-budget-porcupine-graphic.html">the original</a>, used for budget deficits.)</p>

<p>There was discussion among chart academics about whether you should show more data, or whether leaving it out is part of editing. Read both <a href="http://www.thefunctionalart.com/2014/08/to-make-visualizations-that-are.html">Alberto</a> and <a href="http://junkcharts.typepad.com/junk_charts/2014/09/relevance-to-you-or-me-a-response-to-cairo.html">Kaiser&rsquo;s</a> opinions, and form your own.</p>

<p>Who do you agree with and why? Think about your role as a journalist who&rsquo;s good at numbers: how much data should you show to prove your point?</p>

<p>A variety of people wrote about this piece and offered their own interpretations about the Times&#39; report. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/01/opinion/paul-krugman-the-medicare-miracle.html?_r=0">Krugman</a>, <a href="http://www.vox.com/2014/9/4/6101835/five-reasons-health-care-is-no-longer-a-monstrous-budget-buster">Vox</a>, <a href="http://economics21.org/commentary/sorry-new-york-times-medicare-cost-problem-remains-unsolved">Blahaus</a>, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/robert-samuelson-curb-your-enthusiasm-about-those-medicare-savings/2014/09/10/61fee81c-3903-11e4-9c9f-ebb47272e40e_story.html">Wapo</a>, <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/theapothecary/2014/08/31/medicare-no-longer-such-a-budget-buster/">Forbes</a>.</p>

<p>Which of these critiques makes the best or worst argument to a non-expert? Why? Did any of these articles leave you (and, by extension, other smart people) behind? How could they not have?</p>

<p>As always, Excel will determine who leads the discussion.</p>

<h2>Basic skills when your data is bigger</h2>

<p>A digression: sometimes data is published to the web, but, without context, it&rsquo;s hard to know whether it&rsquo;s interesting or not. Here&rsquo;s <a href = "http://schools.nyc.gov/AboutUs/schools/data/Attendance.htm">an example</a> about 
<a href = "http://www.wnyc.org/story/fewer-faces-nyc-schools-after-storm/">NYC school attendance from WNYC.</a></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s easy to pull down this data every day, but, pretty quickly, it&rsquo;s going to get big enough that you will regret any manual labor you might have done in our earlier exercises last week – for example, drunk driving rates in red states vs. blue states.</p>

<h2>Excel work doesn&rsquo;t have to look like it</h2>

<p>Your job is to identify as many people as you can in the picture above.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The easiest people to identify in the picture should be the runners. From  the online <a href="http://boston-iframe.r.mikatiming.de/2013/?event=R&idp=999999117A7326000008693E&pid=start">results</a>, here&rsquo;s <a href="close-finishers.xls">a spreadsheet</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Here&rsquo;s a wrinkle: not everyone in the photo started at the same time. Here&rsquo;s what the race organizers have to say about that: &ldquo;Red bibs (numbers 101 - 8,999) are assigned to Wave 1 (10:00 a.m.). White bibs (numbers 9,000 to 17,999) are assigned to Wave 2 (10:20 a.m.). Blue bibs (numbers 18,000 +) are assigned to Wave 3 (10:40 a.m.).&rdquo;</p></li>
<li><p>Subtract 40 minutes from the finish gun off of everyone with a bib number less than 9000, and 20 minutes from everyone with a bib number from 9000 to 17999.</p></li>
<li><p>Make a list of runners to call. Put their first and last names into separate columns with some combination of &ldquo;Data -&gt; Text to columns&rdquo; and find and replace.</p></li>
<li><p>Here&rsquo;s the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/04/22/sports/boston-moment.html">NYT take.</a></p></li>
</ol>

<h2>Data in the real world</h2>

<p>Unfortunately, data doesn&rsquo;t always come formatted the way we like. Let&rsquo;s take a recent example from last year with some data about successful gun traces out of Chicago. (A <a href="http://www.atf.gov/publications/factsheets/factsheet-national-tracing-center.html">gun trace</a> is where they find out where a gun found in a crime was purchased.) After some phone calls, you get your hands on some source data. Go ahead and <a href="county-data.txt">download it</a> and open it in a spreadsheet.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Take a look at the data. What does one row look like? What does our dream data set look like? Do the things we always do: know dimensions, make a copy, give the columns names.</p></li>
<li><p>Let&rsquo;s think of questions we might ask of our dream data set instead of this data set. What are some headlines we wish we could be able to write? Add a couple of your own in <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/19bZ5tU5acdgRGX45qU_MPYHaCMNaP1cQap094SkXs6o/edit?usp=sharing">this Google Doc</a>. This is a &lsquo;hat-on&rsquo; exercise, so don&rsquo;t be shy.</p></li>
<li><p>Name the sheet <code>traces</code>. How sad does this data make us? </p></li>
<li><p>Make columns called <code>county_clean</code> and <code>state_clean</code> that has just have counties and states only. </p></li>
<li><p>How useful would a pivot table of county_clean be? Do a filter in <code>clean_county</code> for &ldquo;Washington&rdquo;. </p></li>
<li><p>It&rsquo;s pretty clear that we need some data that has unique values for each county. Google &ldquo;US county fips codes&rdquo; and see what the Census has to offer (though any of them are probably fine, we should stick to government data). Save the file locally and enter it as a second sheet in your main Excel file. Call the sheet <code>FIPS</code>. <a class="hidden" href="https://www.census.gov/geo/reference/codes/files/national_county.txt">BLAMO</a> and clean it up, doing the normal things we do.</p></li>
<li><p>Be happy if your sheet looks like this:
<img src="Screenshot 2014-03-02 16.42.54.png"></p></li>
<li><p>Make a new column for the 5-digit county FIPS code for each county. Call it <code>5_digit_fips</code>. There are lots of ways to do this.</p></li>
<li><p>How are we going to join our data?</p></li>
<li><p>Remove the word &ldquo;county&rdquo; from <code>county_name</code> in a new field called <code>county2</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><em>In both sheets</em>, make a new column called <code>joinfield</code> that pastes the county name and state together, separated by a hyphen. You might need to do this in steps.</p></li>
<li><p>We&rsquo;re ready to make a crude attempt a vlookup. Try to get a column called &ldquo;county_fips&rdquo; in your traces sheet.</p></li>
<li><p>Which ones didn&rsquo;t match? Why?</p></li>
<li><p>Make a new field called is_error that gives you a 1 if there is an error and a zero if there is not.</p></li>
<li><p>Sort your traces data by is_error and then count, both decreasing. This will let you prioritize your targets and quantitatively answer how good our merge was. How many do we need to fix? </p></li>
<li><p>Seek and destroy! There&rsquo;s no wrong way to do this, but some ways are righter than others. Keep going until you have matched <em>98 percent of guns and are not missing any counties with more than 30 guns traced</em>. (Protip: a pivot table of <code>is_error</code> and sum of <code>count</code> will be helpful.)</p></li>
<li><p>With the FIPS codes, what can we do that we couldn&rsquo;t before?</p></li>
<li><p>Can we answer this question the way we did this join? &ldquo;What percent of counties had at least one gun traced to Chicago?&rdquo;</p></li>
<li><p>One stats program called R would let us map these without too much trouble. What questions might these maps lead you to ask? Where might you go to get answers?
